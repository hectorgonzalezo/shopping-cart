CAT6 Ethernet cable is used from this board to the LED strips. CAT6 cable is designed for very high bandwidth, minimal cross-talk between twisted pairs, and 100 ohm impedance, for a very high quality signal. The RJ-45 network jacks allow your LED array to be easily disconnected from the electronics.\nFour self-threading screws are supplied with the OctoWS2811 Adaptor board.\nTeensy 3.x is added on top of the adaptor using stacking header pins, or a header and socket pair if you wish to be able to remove the Teensy 3.x board."

The older versions can be used with Teensy 4.0 by wires or an adaptor PCB.\nAll versions of the audio shield support stereo headphone and stereo line-level output, and also stereo line-level input or mono microphone input.\nThe Teensy Audio Library lets you use the input and output simultaneously together with a toolkit of audio processing objects, to easily create all types of sophisticated audio applications. You can play multiple sound files, create synthesized waveforms, apply effects, mix multiple streams and output high quality audio to the headphones or line out pins.\nTeensy 3.x have the Cortex-M4 DSP instructions which provide plenty of computational power for real-time FFT (spectrum analysis), opening up the possibility of creating advanced sound-reactive projects."
